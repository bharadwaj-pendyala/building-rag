The trench run in the Battle of Yavin:
Luke Skywalker: "R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down."
[R2 beeps in response.]

[Over the comms] 
Red Leader: "Luke, let me know when you're going in."
Luke Skywalker: "I'm on it."

Darth Vader: "I have you now."

[Obi-Wan's voice] 
Obi-Wan: "Use the Force, Luke."
Luke Skywalker: [deactivates his targeting computer] "I will."

With one last effort, Luke fires torpedoes into the Death Starâ€™s exhaust port. The massive space station explodes, signaling victory for the Rebel Alliance.
